# GyP Get your Password App.
## Description
This is the week 5 challenge, the project is to create an app that generates safe passwords.
- With this app users will have safe passwords for using where they are required.
- I have learned in this project:
  - How to use the method .concat.
  - How to use the function getRandom().
  - How to use the method .join.
  - I can use if statements without else.
  - How to use "!" to force a result.
## Logic 
- I have created all the variables that I will need to prompt the requirements for the users to generate the passwords, they will type the length of the password that they want.

- I have created an object called return and I store there all the variables previously created with a value that I will use later to generate the password

- Then, the function getRandom(arr) generates a valid random index for the array passed as an argument and then returns the element corresponding to that index, as I understand, this function will provide the connection between the previous and the following logics.

- From my point of view this is the core of the app, where the magic happens.
  - This function generates a random password based on the options shown to the user.
  - The function uses user-provided options to determine which types of characters to include in the password (lowercase, uppercase, numeric, special, emojis) and then generates a random password that meets those specifications. The final password is shuffled to ensure that guaranteed characters appear in a random order.

  - These variables contain arrays that will be used in the if statement to generate the passwords.

  - With the concat method the different types of characters will show all together as a result for the user.
  - The push method will put them into the array.
  - The random result will be generated by the getRandom function that is used as an argument, the variables containing the arrays of characters.

  - The for loop is in charge of shuffling the characters just before been shown.

  - Finally, return guaranteedCharacters will show the password helped by the .join method that is in charge of joining all the elements in the array guaranteedCharacters.
