# GyP Get your Password App.

## Description

This is the week 5 challenge, the project is create an app that generate safe passwords.

- With this app users will have safe passwords for using where they are required.
- I have learned in this project:
  - How to use the method .concat.
  - How to use the function getRandom().
  - How to use the method .join.
  - I can use if statements with out else.
  - How to use "!" to force a result.



## Logic 
- I have created all the variables that I will need to prompt the requirements for the users to generate the passwords, they will type the length of the password that they want.

- I have created an object called return and I storage there all the variables previously created with a value that I will use later for generate the password

- Then, the function getRandom(arr) generates a valid random index for the array passed as an argument and then returns the element corresponding to that index, as I understand, this fuction will provide the connection between the previous and the following logics.
